### What does done mean?
“Done” means a deployed website that allows a user to input a date and location, and then receive weather and appropriate clothing data based on those parameters. 

### What does success look like for this project? 
“Success” includes all of "Done" & a nicely styled & formatted website, a well-thought-out algorithm for clothing selection and an informative error-handling system. Something that I would be proud to show off.
